The Royal Readme List ~ Semi-full completion :l

Would be Nice to obtain permissions from chucklefish to use thier modifications for this : http://www.mapeditor.org/
Its what chucklefish used internally to make the fancy dungeons/shipworld/ect

Sprite Art ~
Nearly all of the objects are a funky resolution ..... some are really bad
I just want to go through them and perhaps make some better texures before putting them all back in

Materials/Shiptiles ~
We need more tiles and the more the merrier because SidofEvil's tiletemplate is so good

Lua/Techs ~
New Ship AI Menu ~ The shipworld can only be edited when a option in the AI menu is toggled off 

Note A ~ By default the ship will be protected from modification 
Note B ~ Toggle for ship protection will be unlocked after you get all the spacesuit parts from the first mission

All kinds lua needs fixing ~ 
Vents will have unique variants for each race, thats why I moved the lua and breach sound
