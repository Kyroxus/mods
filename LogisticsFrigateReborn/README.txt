Logistics Frigate Reborn – graycatgrayhat

Special thanks to @Kayuko, @lazarus76, and @Ancev Caine on the Starbound forums as both v3.0 and v4.0 would not be without them.

README

Windows Notepad and Windows Wordpad are terrible software for text editing, I would recommend Notepad++.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

STEP 1. Extract the LogisticsFrigateReborn.zip to the mods folder located here:
***\Steam\steamapps\common\Starbound\giraffe_storage\mods
STEP 2.

	Option 1. Clean and simple option is to start a new character.

	Option 2) Dirty swap method if you want to use the ship with a already-generated character.

		Step 1) Backup everything in the "giraffe_storage" folder first, so you can revert if something goes wrong.

		Step 2) Remove and store everything from within your current ship, best to do it on a monster free flat plant.  
				*****Warning anything not removed will be overwritten.*****

		Step 3) Locate the folder "player" here ***\Steam\steamapps\common\Starbound\giraffe_storage\player

		Step 4) Locate the .shipworld of the character whose ship is being replaced, copy the file name into a text file.
			It should look like this "71727dc8856de9dfd6b9d5255c912c17.player" but not those exact digits.

		Step 5) Launch Starbound, start a new character, exit Starbound.

		Step 6) Locate and rename the newest .shipworld file to the file name you copied in "Step 4".

		Step 7) Launch Starbound, delete the newly made character, then start in single player with the older character and enjoy the new ship.

		Step 8) Remember to retrieve everything from world side and place it in the new ship.
